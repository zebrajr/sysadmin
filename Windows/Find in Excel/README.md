### Situation
Having to find if a value is found in a huge amount of Excel spreadsheets, spread among folders and sub folders, with no similarities in them (same column names, all the same columns, etc).

### Task
Automate the process so that the user does not have to search each file individually.

### Action
- Edit the values in mainScript.ps1
- Run mainScript.ps1

### Result
A formatted table which displays if the value was found, in which spreadsheet, row and column

### Note
searchExcel.ps1 contains the method, so if needed, one can call the script to search just a single file.

### ToDo
